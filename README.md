## Evaluations

There are separate interview outcome forms that must be submitted for each phase (necessary for good data tracking in HubSpot!) Please make sure you’re submitting the correct form for the phase interview you’re conducting:

Phase 2 IV Outcome: http://hs.learnersguild.org/phase-2-interview-outcome / pw = “theguildphase2”
Phase 3 IV Outcome: http://hs.learnersguild.org/phase-3-interview-outcome / pw = “theguildphase3"
Phase 4 IV Outcome: http://hs.learnersguild.org/phase-4-interview-outcome / pw = “theguildphase4”

*Note*: If the learner you interview is accepted, a new piece of data you’ll be asked to include in the outcome form is the Phase Start Date - basically, the Monday of their first week in the new phase. This data point is what will help us keep track of people’s movement through phases and their interview schedule, so super important to make it accurate. Please let Carla know if you have any questions about this!
